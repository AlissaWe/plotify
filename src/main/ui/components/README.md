# mdl-react components
This folder contains mdl-react components. These components are implemented to serve our current needs and are not implemented to fulfill the mdl standards.

Make sure to include
 
* the main mdl css file 
* our *mdl-react.css* 

in your index.html or main css file _before_ your own customizations.
